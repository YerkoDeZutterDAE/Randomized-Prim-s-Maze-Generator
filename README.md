# Randomized Prim's Maze-Generator

Here i will make a Grig based Maze generater.
Whit the Randomized Prim's algorithem.

Build on the GamePlay Programing framework from school.

This is for my GamePlay Programing research exam.

this Maze Generaroe uses the Randomized Prim's algorithem. So it adds more random path, turns and unpredictability into the maze.

prosses:
The maze starts out as just a grid full of walls. And 1 free space.
It well then take 1 of the walls next to the free space randomly.

Then it will firstle make sure it does not have 2 or more free spaces next to this wall.
If it does have 2 or more it will ignore this space and keep it a wall. 
So that it does not make the maze to easy. Whit to mutch options to the desired location.
If it als less then 2 free spaces next to the wall. It will them turn the wall into a free space.
And it will add the neighboring walls into the possible changeable walls.

So it can take a random one out of that list. To turn into a free space.
